Statistical Analysis
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
All three lots' variance totals 76.23 lbs which is below the 100 lb requirement. Lot 3 however has a variance of 220 lbs which does not meet the design specifications.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
The t-test shows the P-value is 1 which means we can reject the null hypothesis and predict that the PSI across all manufacturing lots is not statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 lbs per sq in.

For lot 1:
The P-value is less than 0.05 which means we can reject the null hypothesis for this grouping.<br>
For lot 2:
The P-value is 0.89 which means we cannot reject the null hypothesis for this grouping.<br>
For lot 3:
The P-value is 0.79 which means we cannot reject the null hypothesis for this grouping.<br>

For both lot 2 and 3 the means are not statistically different from the population mean of 1500 lbs per sq in. However the mean of lot 1 is statistically different from the population mean of 1500 lbs per sq in.
